### Hi there, I'm PatricðŸ‘‹

I have created this page for the Predictive Analytics course which is part of my MSc in Data Management & Business Analytics at EDHEC.
As a first step, I will use the course exclusively for assignments related to my studies. At a later stage, I will also use it for my own projects.
